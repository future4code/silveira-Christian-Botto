    <div class="title">Guessing Game!</div> 
    <br>
This is a project written on javascript.
The rules are pretty simple: You need to guess which number, between 1 and 100, the computer ramdomly generated.
If your guess is too low, the computer will tell you to try a higher one.
Similarly, if your guess is too high, the computer will tell you to try a lower one.
When you fifnally guess the correct number, the computer will congratulate you and tell you how many guesses did it take for you to guess the correct number.
Have fun!
